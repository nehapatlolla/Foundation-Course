      <h3>Intended Audience</h3>
      <p>
        This tutorial assumes that you already have a static React site
        (Gastsby/Next) being deployed on Vercel or Netlify.
      </p>
      <p></p>
        It's written with the intermediate React developer in mind; if you're
        newer to the modern JS ecosystem, it might be a bit hard to follow.
